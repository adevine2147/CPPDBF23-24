# AIAA Design/Build/Fly Competition - Top Proposals Analysis

## Common Elements:

- **Clear Objectives**: All three proposals have a clear understanding of the competition's objectives and requirements. They emphasize the importance of meeting specific mission goals and scoring criteria.

- **Structured Approach**: Each proposal follows a structured approach, including sections on executive summaries, team organization, conceptual design, manufacturing plans, and test planning. This organization makes it easier for judges to navigate and evaluate the content.

- **Technical Details**: The proposals provide technical details related to aircraft design, including aerodynamics, propulsion, materials, and structural analysis. They show a strong understanding of engineering principles and how they apply to the competition.

- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Sensitivity analysis is used in all three proposals to optimize the design for mission success. This demonstrates a data-driven approach and an understanding of the interplay between design parameters and mission outcomes.

- **Iterative Design**: The proposals emphasize iterative design and testing, indicating a commitment to refining the aircraft's performance through practical experimentation.

- **Team Organization**: Each team has a well-organized structure with designated roles and responsibilities, including faculty advisors. This demonstrates effective teamwork and leadership.

## What They Are Doing Right:

- **Mission Focus**: All proposals prioritize the most critical mission (in this case, Mission 3) based on sensitivity analysis, demonstrating a strategic approach to scoring maximum points.

- **Mathematical Modeling and Simulations**: They make effective use of mathematical modeling and simulations (e.g., MATLAB, CFD) to inform their design decisions and optimize performance.

- **Detailed Manufacturing Plans**: The proposals outline comprehensive manufacturing plans, specifying materials, fabrication techniques, and quality control measures.

- **Testing Strategy**: Each team has a well-thought-out testing strategy that includes both ground and flight tests. This iterative approach helps identify and address design flaws.

- **Financial Planning**: Budgeting and financial planning are included, showing an awareness of the costs associated with participating in the competition.

## What Judges Are Likely Looking For:

When grading these proposals, judges are likely looking for the following key factors:

- **Innovation**: Judges may be interested in innovative design solutions and unique approaches to solving the competition's challenges.

- **Technical Competence**: They expect a strong grasp of engineering principles, as demonstrated through the technical content of the proposals.

- **Mission Optimization**: The ability to optimize the aircraft design to maximize mission-specific scores is likely to be highly valued.

- **Teamwork and Leadership**: Effective team organization, leadership, and collaboration are essential, as they reflect the team's ability to execute their plan.

- **Practicality**: Judges may assess the feasibility and practicality of the proposed design and manufacturing processes.

- **Data-Driven Decision-Making**: The use of data, simulations, and sensitivity analysis to drive design decisions and achieve mission goals is likely to be positively evaluated.

- **Safety and Reliability**: Ensuring the safety and reliability of the aircraft through thorough testing and quality control measures is crucial.

- **Budget Management**: Judges may consider how well the teams have managed their budgets and secured funding for their project.




**Areas for Improvement (Common Across Proposals):**

1.  **Subcomponent Design Schedule:** The proposals lack detailed schedules for subcomponent design. Providing comprehensive schedules for the design and development of individual components could strengthen all three proposals.
    
2.  **Optimization of Ground Mission Weight and Antenna Length:** The proposals could benefit from more detailed information about the teams' approaches to optimizing ground mission weight and antenna length. Offering specific strategies and calculations related to these parameters could enhance the proposals.


3. Ground Mission: The proposal lacks information about the ground mission, including details about the weight to be loaded onto the aircraft. Providing a comprehensive plan for the ground mission would enhance the proposal.

4. Payload Range: The proposed payload range of 1-20 pounds is considered unrealistic. Consider specifying a more reasonable payload range.

5 Optimization and Trade Studies: The methods used for optimization and trade studies could be explained in more detail to provide greater transparency.

6. Design Consistency: Ensure that the proposal maintains consistency between textual descriptions and graphical representations. For example, clarify whether the wing design is rectangular or tapered, and ensure that the number of fasteners aligns with competition rules.

7. Weight, Drag, and Energy Estimation: Include discussions about weight, drag, and mission energy estimation methods. Provide a breakdown of expected empty weight or a goal empty weight.

8. Wind Tunnel Testing: If wind tunnel testing is part of the plan, ensure it is discussed in the proposal, as it appears as a block in the schedule.

9. Testing Plan Detail: Strengthen the description of the testing plan by providing more comprehensive details.

10. Clarify and Correct Discrepancies: Address discrepancies between textual descriptions and visual representations, such as the wing design and fastener counts.

11. Schedule for Prototype Manufacturing: Include a schedule for the manufacturing of the prototype, as it is a crucial aspect of the project.
