# AIAA Design/Build/Fly Competition - Top Proposals Analysis

## Common Elements:

- **Clear Objectives**: All three proposals have a clear understanding of the competition's objectives and requirements. They emphasize the importance of meeting specific mission goals and scoring criteria.

- **Structured Approach**: Each proposal follows a structured approach, including sections on executive summaries, team organization, conceptual design, manufacturing plans, and test planning. This organization makes it easier for judges to navigate and evaluate the content.

- **Technical Details**: The proposals provide technical details related to aircraft design, including aerodynamics, propulsion, materials, and structural analysis. They show a strong understanding of engineering principles and how they apply to the competition.

- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Sensitivity analysis is used in all three proposals to optimize the design for mission success. This demonstrates a data-driven approach and an understanding of the interplay between design parameters and mission outcomes.

- **Iterative Design**: The proposals emphasize iterative design and testing, indicating a commitment to refining the aircraft's performance through practical experimentation.

- **Team Organization**: Each team has a well-organized structure with designated roles and responsibilities, including faculty advisors. This demonstrates effective teamwork and leadership.

## What They Are Doing Right:

- **Mission Focus**: All proposals prioritize the most critical mission (in this case, Mission 3) based on sensitivity analysis, demonstrating a strategic approach to scoring maximum points.

- **Mathematical Modeling and Simulations**: They make effective use of mathematical modeling and simulations (e.g., MATLAB, CFD) to inform their design decisions and optimize performance.

- **Detailed Manufacturing Plans**: The proposals outline comprehensive manufacturing plans, specifying materials, fabrication techniques, and quality control measures.

- **Testing Strategy**: Each team has a well-thought-out testing strategy that includes both ground and flight tests. This iterative approach helps identify and address design flaws.

- **Financial Planning**: Budgeting and financial planning are included, showing an awareness of the costs associated with participating in the competition.

## What Judges Are Likely Looking For:

When grading these proposals, judges are likely looking for the following key factors:

- **Innovation**: Judges may be interested in innovative design solutions and unique approaches to solving the competition's challenges.

- **Technical Competence**: They expect a strong grasp of engineering principles, as demonstrated through the technical content of the proposals.

- **Mission Optimization**: The ability to optimize the aircraft design to maximize mission-specific scores is likely to be highly valued.

- **Teamwork and Leadership**: Effective team organization, leadership, and collaboration are essential, as they reflect the team's ability to execute their plan.

- **Practicality**: Judges may assess the feasibility and practicality of the proposed design and manufacturing processes.

- **Data-Driven Decision-Making**: The use of data, simulations, and sensitivity analysis to drive design decisions and achieve mission goals is likely to be positively evaluated.

- **Safety and Reliability**: Ensuring the safety and reliability of the aircraft through thorough testing and quality control measures is crucial.

- **Budget Management**: Judges may consider how well the teams have managed their budgets and secured funding for their project.

In summary, the top three proposals for the AIAA Design/Build/Fly Competition have common elements related to clear objectives, structured approaches, technical details, sensitivity analysis, teamwork, and more. They excel in mission-focused design, mathematical modeling, and simulations. Judges are likely looking for innovation, technical competence, practicality, data-driven decision-making, and effective teamwork when evaluating these proposals.
