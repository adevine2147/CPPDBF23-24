Week # 6     Date: 09/30/23    -    10/06/23

# Aerodynamics Team
### Due milestones: 
Meeting 10/02/2023 Trade matrix updates and progress check-in.
### Completed milestones: 
Most components finished 80% completed Airfoil NACA estimated: 64-ish.
### Cost: $0
### Upcoming milestones: 
Complete trade matrix and share to the Structures team and start CAD. 
***Additional Comments: ***
Got to contact people who did not make it to the meeting and share updates for the structures team.

# Structures Team (Wed)
### Due milestones: 
Learn the program for structures machines for next week's practice for laser and foam cutting.
### Completed milestones: 
 Had the team gather two airfoils: NACA 0012 & NACA 4412 from the NACA Airfoil Website and convert it into a SVG file to be edited in Inkscape. This allowed it to be compatible with the Hotwire Foam Cutter (HWFC) and allowed for the creation of a hole for the wing spar. 
It was then exported as a .DXF file into Vector Tracer which allowed it to create the basic command for the airfoil. Then finally exported as a tap file which was the file type that the HWFC (via MACH 4) would read in order to correctly cut out the airfoil. 
A dry run was first done in order to correctly verify if the HWFC was functioning correctly. The material used for the cutting was a pink insulation foam with 2 in of thickness in order to cut both airfoil shapes with a 2.5 ft span. This was done at 25 PSI.
### Cost: $109.46 
(total cost = [$49.98 * 2] + Tax) ( For the Styrofoam used)
### Upcoming milestones: 
The Wednesday team will study vacuum bagging techniques, resin safety, and handling safety for laminated materials such as: carbon fiber and fiberglass.

# Structures Team (Fri)
### Due milestones: 
Members are looking to go through the Innovation Idea Labs training, analysis of wing geometry, and begin trade studies.
### Completed milestones: 
Arrival at the Innovation Idea Labs (IIL) in order to use the Laguna Laser CNC to cut out an 18 in Cord airfoil following the NACA 0012 & 4412 patterns. If there is time, then the team will practice putting Mylar (also known as BoPET) on existing wings in the lab.
### Cost: $85.97 
(2'x4'x1/4" plywood sheets 2BC 1Birch)
### Upcoming milestones: 
Make 12 in versions of both airfoils, due next Friday. Possibly also preparing for cutting 3.16 in balsa wood.

# Payload Team
### Due milestones: 
Updates on payload bay design drafts.

### Completed milestones:
Team getting familiar with Solidworks and beginning a rough design of the dimensions of the payload bay for Structures/Manufacturing.
### Cost: $0
### Upcoming milestones:
Finish payload bay design by Friday (10/13/2023) with a top, side, and frontal view of payload dimensions. Also begin brainstorming a latching method to access the payload.
***Additional Comments: ***
Structures/Manufacturing and Payload are still waiting on Aero for dimensions of the fuselage.










Systems Team

Completed milestones: 
Finish section 1.0 and partial of 3.0 for the proposal



Cost: $0
Upcoming milestones: 
Finish the Gantt Chart and start updating with Structures for the manufacturing plan on proposal 4.0, section 3.0, and Section 2.0 from the PM by October 11th
